**SimBatt** is a MATLAB-based tool for simulating the flight trajectories of electric-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It combines a 5-DOF flight dynamics model with a detailed battery performance module, making it ideal for mission planning, performance analysis, and endurance estimation for fixed-wing electric aircraft.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive GUI:** A user-friendly interface to easily set up and run complex analyses without touching the source code.
-   **Advanced Battery Model:** Utilizes a constant power discharge method that accurately reflects real-world flight conditions.
-   **Modular Mission Planning:** Define complex flight plans with multiple segments (straight, turn) and control parameters.
-   **Comprehensive Plotting:** Automatically generates detailed performance graphs for trajectory, power, SOC, and more.

## How It Works

SimBatt streamlines the simulation process into four main stages, from initial setup to final analysis.

1.  **Setup:** Configure aircraft dimensions, mass, motor specs, and battery parameters using the interactive GUI.
2.  **Mission Definition:** Define a multi-stage mission profile in the mission table, setting RPM, turn direction, and segment length for each phase.
3.  **Simulation Core:** The 5-DOF solver, using an adaptive Runge-Kutta method, calculates the aircraft's state at each time step.
4.  **Analysis:** Visualize the results with automatically generated plots for 3D trajectory, SOC, voltage, current, and aerodynamic coefficients.

## Methodology Spotlight

#### Flight Dynamics
The 5-DOF model solves the primary equations of motion, assuming coordinated flight:

* **Velocity Derivative ($\dot{V}$):**
    $$\dot{V} = \frac{1}{m}[T\cos\alpha - D] - g\sin\gamma$$
* **Heading Angle Derivative ($\dot{\beta}$):**
    $$\dot{\beta} = \frac{1}{mV}[T\sin\alpha + L]\frac{\sin\mu}{\cos\gamma}$$
* **Flight Path Angle Derivative ($\dot{\gamma}$):**
    $$\dot{\gamma} = \frac{1}{mV}[T\sin\alpha + L]\cos\mu - \frac{g}{V}\cos\gamma$$

#### Battery Modeling
The battery's State of Charge (SOC) is estimated using a constant power discharge model, which is ideal for aircraft where power output remains stable during cruise.

1.  **Curve Collapse:** Multiple constant-current discharge curves are "collapsed" into a single characteristic curve by finding an optimal exponent, **n**.
    $$I^n V = \text{Constant}$$
2.  **Model Fitting:** This collapsed curve is fitted to a rational polynomial function of SOC.
    $$V I^n(\text{SOC}) = \frac{a+c\cdot\text{SOC}+e\cdot\text{SOC}^2}{1+b\cdot\text{SOC}+d\cdot\text{SOC}^2+f\cdot\text{SOC}^3}$$
